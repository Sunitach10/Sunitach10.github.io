 In previous postÂ (<a href="https://blog.bayeslabs.co/2019/07/04/Generating-Molecules-using-Char-RNN-in-Pytorch.html</a>).
 I have explained about Generation of molecues using SMILE Dataset. But I want to explore the things if we have to work on Graph dataset.
 
 SMILES strings are generated from a graph-based representation of molecules, thereby working in the original graph space has the benefit of 
 removing additional overhead. With recent progress in the area of deep learning on graphs, training deep generative models directly on 
 graph representations becomes a feasible alternative that has been explored in a range of recent works.
 
 <b>Why GCN-</b>
 Recently, there is increasing interest in extending deep learning approaches for graph data. Driven by the success of deep learning, researchers have borrowed ideas from convolution networks, 
 recurrent networks, and deep autoencoders to design the architecture of graph neural networks.
While deep learning has achieved great success on Euclidean data, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from the
non-Euclidean domain and need to be effectively analyzed. For instance, in e-commerce, a graph-based learning system is able to exploit the
interactions between users and products to make highly accurate recommendations.
In chemistry, molecules are modeled as graphs and their bio-activity needs to be identified for drug discovery. User data on social networks,
gene data on biological regulatory networks, log data on telecommunication networks, or text documents on word embeddings are important examples 
of data lying on irregular or non-Euclidean domains that can be structured with graphs. which are universal representations of heterogeneous pair wise relationships. 
Graphs can encode complex geometric structures and can be studied with strong mathematical tools such as spectral graph theory (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596.pdf"</a>). 
The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. This is because graph data are irregular. Each graph has a variable size of 
unordered nodes and each node in a graph has a different number of neighbors, causing some important operations (e.g., convolutions), 
which are easy to compute in the image domain but are not directly applicable to the graph domain anymore.
To handle the complexity of graph data, new generalizations and definitions for important operations have been rapidly developed over the past few years. 
For instance, Below Figure illustrates how a kind of graph convolution is inspired by a standard 2D convolution. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these methods, 
for both interested researchers who want to enter this rapidly developing field and experts who would like to compare graph neural network algorithms.

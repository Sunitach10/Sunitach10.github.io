<b>Deep generative models</b> for graph-structured data offer a new angle on the problem of chemical synthesis: by optimizing differentiable 
models that directly generate molecular graphs,I am writing about MolGAN, an implicit, likelihood free generative model for small molecular
graphs .Here we will use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on graph-structured data.
We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired/particular 
chemical properties.

<b>Dataset-</b>In implementation we used the QM9 chemical database, we found that our model is capable of generating close to 100% valid 
compounds.and we used RDKIT library.

<b>Introduction</b> – Generating new chemical compounds with desired properties is a challenging task with important applications such as 
(Schneider & Fechner, 2005) Drug Discovery.Most works in this area make use of a so-called SMILES representation 
(what is smile representation of molecules.<a href="https://https://github.com/bayeslabs/bayeslabs.github.io/tree/master/_posts">I have explained in my previous blog</a>)

<b>**</b> Discovery of potential drugs for new targets is an expensive and time consuming process so we can use deep learning in the pipeline of 
drug-discovery to save the time and cost.<b>**</b>
In previous blog(link………………),I wrote about use of deep learning architecture in identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) strength
(binding affinity) using character-based sequence representation approach.
The successful identification of drug–target interactions (DTI) is a critical step in drug discovery. 
As the field of drug discovery expands with the discovery of new drugs, repurposing of existing drugs and identification of novel 
interacting partners for approved drugs is also gaining interest.
The protein–ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also called binding affinity and we are predicting this
value using <b>deep learning architectures</b>.Furthermore, a regression-based model brings in the advantage of predicting an approximate 
value for the strength of the interaction between the drug and target which in turn would be significantly beneficial for limiting the 
large compound search-space in drug discovery studies.

In this model, I used the word-based sequence representation. it is a promising alternative to the character-based sequence representation
approach (previous blog)in deep learning models for binding affinity prediction.

Class activation maps are a simple technique to get the discriminative image regions used by a CNN to identify a specific class in the image. In other words, a class activation map (CAM) lets us see which regions in the image were relevant to this class. This also shows which part of the image /molecule is more important/attentionable to classify the molecule and image.
